Terraform configuration files and Ansible roles for setting up my website and applications on Linode. \
The goal is to be able to quickly spin up a website, mailserver and trilium host with only one command and be able to easily manage it \
through simply running terraform. All roles and configuration files should be writte in a way that makes them idempotent. \


Currently working on 
- [ ] Nginx + Let's Encrypt ansible role
- [ ] Trilium role
- [ ] Postfix + Dovecot role
- [ ] Kanboard role
- [ ] Firefly III role
